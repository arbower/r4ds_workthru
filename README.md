## Installation
 1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/arbower/r4ds_workthru.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd r4ds_workthru
    ```

3. Open the R project file in RStudio:
    ```
    r4ds.Rproj
    ```

## Usage
It would be best if you worked through the book yourself; I didn't always do the homework correctly and skipped some problems. I also tend to swear and have pointed opinions about the tech industry.
